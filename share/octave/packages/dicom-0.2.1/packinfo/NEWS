 Summary of important user-visible changes for dicom 0.1.1 (2011/11):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The function isdicom has been completely rewritten and will perform
    much faster for invalid dicom files.  It also no longer accepts a cell
    array of strings since it reduces its usefulness by other functions.
    Such use can be replaced with:

      cellfun (@isdicom, cell_array_filenames)

 ** The dicom package no longer autoloads by default.  Please load the
    package manually with `pkg load dicom' or add it to the `.octaverc'
    file to load it automatically at the start of each Octave session.
